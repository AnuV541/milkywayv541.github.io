		<p style="color:white"> Doodles are simple drawings that can have concrete representational meaning or may just be composed of random and abstract lines or shapes, generally without ever
		lifting the drawing device from the paper, in which case it is usually called a scribble.The word Doodle first appeared in the early 17th century to mean a fool 
		or simpleton. It may derive from the German Dudeltopf or Dudeldop, meaning simpleton or noodle.</p>

    				<p style="color:white"> Doodling can be used as a stress relieving technique. This is similar to other motor activities such as pacing that are also used to alleviate mental stress.Scientists belive that doodling's stress relieving properties arise from the way that the act of dooling engages with the brain's default mode network.</p>  			</div>
